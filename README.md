# Running a Flask Application with MongoDB using Docker

In this tutorial, we'll set up and run a Flask application with MongoDB using Docker containers. We'll use Docker Compose to manage the containers and define our application services.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download and install Docker Desktop from the official website: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step 1: Set up the Flask Application

1. Create a directory for your Flask application:

    ```bash
    mkdir flask_app
    cd flask_app
    ```

2. Inside the `flask_app` directory, create a new file named `app.py` and add the following code:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello, Flask!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
    ```

3. Create a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory and add the following content:

    ```
    Flask==2.0.2
    ```

4. Initialize a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Step 2: Set up MongoDB Container

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `flask_app` directory with the following content:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      mongo:
        image: mongo:latest
        ports:
          - "27017:27017"
        volumes:
          - mongo-data:/data/db

    volumes:
      mongo-data:
    ```

2. This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service named `mongo` using the official MongoDB Docker image. It exposes port 27017 and mounts a volume for data persistence.

## Step 3: Run the Application

1. Start the Docker containers by running the following command in the `flask_app` directory:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

2. Docker Compose will pull the MongoDB image (if not already available) and start the containers. You should see MongoDB logs in the terminal.

3. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `flask_app` directory.

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6. You should see output indicating that the Flask application is running.

## Step 4: Test the Application

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the message "Hello, Flask!" displayed.

2. You can also use tools like `curl` or `Postman` to send requests to the Flask application.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to set up and run a Flask application with MongoDB using Docker containers. You can now build upon this setup to develop more complex web applications.
